# Debugging Challenge: Logical Error in Mapping with Modulo Operator

You are tasked with debugging the `get_service_description()` function, which attempts to map service names to their descriptions. The mapping strategy involves the position of the service name in a list and a modulo operator to handle index wrapping. However, there is a subtle error ?!?!??!

## JSON File (`services.json`)

```json
{
    "services": [
        {"name": "Technical Workshops", "description": "Learn cutting-edge technologies with hands-on workshops."},
        {"name": "Hackathons", "description": "Participate in exciting coding competitions."},
        {"name": "Industry Talks", "description": "Gain insights from industry experts."},
        {"name": "Peer Mentorship", "description": "Collaborate with peers for mutual growth."}
    ]
}
```

## Faulty Code

```python
def get_service_description(service_name):
    services_map = load_services()
    sorted_keys = list(services_map.keys())
    index = sorted_keys.index(service_name)
    mapped_key = sorted_keys[(index + len(sorted_keys)) % len(service_name)] 
    return services_map[mapped_key]
```
